## About

Trainquil is a training app that differentiates itself by being simple, fast, and powerful. While
there are many excellent training apps available, Trainquil provides a unique approach.

In all categories, I am not trying to claim that Trainquil is the best (i.e. the fastest, most
feature-rich, or most native). But Trainquil is competitive in all three categories and doesn't
make you choose between them.

Trainquil intends to push boundaries by exposing modern, opt-in features that enable lifters to get
more from time spent in the gym.

While aiming for this goal, our first step is to make Trainquil one of the best training apps for
intermediate lifters, remaining compatible with users at all levels while supporting the majority
of use cases in the ecosystem. You can use Trainquil as a drop-in replacement for your existing
training logs.
